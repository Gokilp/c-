#50 Days Coding Challenge

This repository is dedicated to the 50 Days of Code Challenge, which is an initiative designed to help you improve your coding skills by committing to code for at least an hour every day for 50 consecutive days. By the end of the challenge, you'll have completed a significant amount of coding and made meaningful progress towards your coding goals.

The challenge is open to coders of all levels, whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced programmer looking to improve your skills. All you need is a computer and a willingness to commit to coding for an hour each day.

To participate in the challenge, simply fork this repository and commit to coding for at least an hour every day for the next 50 days. You can work on any project you like, whether it's a personal project or a contribution to an open-source project. The goal is simply to commit to coding every day and to build a consistent coding habit.
